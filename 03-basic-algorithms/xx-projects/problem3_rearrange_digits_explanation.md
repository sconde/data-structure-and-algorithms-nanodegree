# Problem 3: Rearrange Array Elements

I opted to use the quicksort algorithm, as I already had implemented this. First, I sort the array. Then reverse it.

Time complexity: The solution is based on quicksort so the algortih is __O( n log n)__

Space complexity: the quicksort recursive algorithm consumes memory on the stack, thus the space complexity is __O(log n)__
