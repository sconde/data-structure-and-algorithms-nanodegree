# Problem 3: Explanation

The implementation of the [__Huffmann Algorithm__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding), has consisted _as pseudo code tasks were resolved_, in the construction of several __classes__, being:

1. Node
2. Queue
3. Tree
4. HuffmanEncoder 

This has allowed to have a more encapsulated development, as well as, providing the project with a more consistent structure. 
The compresing algorithm has shown, for the tested example a reduction of almost 50% of its size. 

## Time/Space complexity

In respects to the study of the _time complexity_, would be __O(Ln)__, being _**L**_ the maximum length of a codeword;  more references see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding#Optimality). 
If I had not used a _built it_  function for sorting the input that takes __O(n*log(n))__; ending up the time complexity being __O(n*log(n))__. 
In  respects to the _space complexity_, it is directly related to the __size of the employed alphabet__, in this case **_k_**, resulting in __O(k)__.
