# Run time analysis: Unscramble Computer Science Problems

## Task 0
Time Complexity: O(1) since access on a Python array has O(1)
Description:
- Only accessing the 2 elements directory from the lists


## Task 1
Time Complexity: O(n)
Description: 
- Two lists are looped through once each.
- Then each list item is added to a set if it is unique ( hashing ) which on average is an O(1) operation.


## Task 2
Time Complexity: O(n)
Description: 
- List is looped through once.
- Using a dictionary, the cost of adding an element is on average  O(1) for a hashmap (using the `.get` method).
- To obtain the max of the of the dictionary is at most O(n).
- Thus, overal time Complexity is O(N)


## Task 3
Time Complexity: O(n+nlogn)
Description: 
- O(n log n) list sorting operation 
- full scan through the list - O( n)


## Task 4
Time Complexity: O(n+nlogn)
Description: For loop and python sort
- Four set add operations that scans the list to add - O(n)
- O(n log n ) for sorting
