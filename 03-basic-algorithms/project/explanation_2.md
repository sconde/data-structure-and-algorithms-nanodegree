# # Rotated array search

I opted for an iterative solution based on binary search and not a recursive solution mainly for the benefit of a constant memory.

Time complexity: __O(log n)__

Space complexity: Space complexity: the memory complexity for this solution is constant __O(1)__

comment: The previous review marked the above explanation incorrect and said I had used recursion!
