# Problem 1: Explanation

For the __LRU_Cache__ problem, after thinking of using different approaches (included previous failures), it has been decided to use the __OrderedDict()__, specifically the use of the _method_ __.popitem(last=False)__. 
It allows to  remove the _first added element_, which is basic for the __priority construction__ demanded. 


## Time/Space complexity

In respects to the limitation of the _cache_, any hashing approach has been discarded, as the __risk of collision__,  hence the necessity of adding a __nested hash__ (reaching __O(n)__). 
Finally deciding for this approach that satisfies the __O(1)__ requirement. 
As in therms of _space complexity_, the structure requires the usage of __c__, being __c__ the desired *LRU_Cache* capacity; being it in the end assimilable to __O(n)__.
