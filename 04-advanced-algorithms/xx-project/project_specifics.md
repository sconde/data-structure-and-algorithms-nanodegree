# Project Specifics

## Project Instructions

The next section is a Jupyter Notebook which contains all the instructions for the project. We recommend that you have two files open in separate tabs while working on this project: `project_notebook.ipynb`. Further instructions and tips for the functions to implement can be found in the notebook!

Evaluation
----------

Once you have completed your project, use the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2499/view) to review the project. If you have covered all of the points in the rubric, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

When you're done with the project please double check any **outside sources have been correctly cited** before submitting. You should submit **from the Jupyter notebook** by clicking the big Submit button in the bottom right.
