# Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

## method: find
    
Time complexity: __O(n)__ since I looped through each character

Space complexity: __(1)__ as I don't use additonal memory

## method: insert
    
Time complexity:  __O(n)__ since I looped through each character

Space complexity: __O(n)__ for the characters length to be allocated


## method: suffixes
    
Time complexity: __O(n)__ since I looped through each character

Space complexity: __(1)__ as I don't use additonal memory
