# Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

## method: add handler
    
Time complexity: __O(n)__ since I looped through each part of the path

Space complexity: __(n)__ for a new `TrieNode` is created for each part of the path

## method: lookup
    
Time complexity: __O(n)__ since I looped through each part

Space complexity: __(1)__ as I don't use additonal memory
