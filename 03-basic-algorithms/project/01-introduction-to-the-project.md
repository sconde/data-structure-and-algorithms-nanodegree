Data Structure Questions
------------------------

For this project, you will answer the **seven** questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a variety of topics related to the basic algorithms you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.

A qualified reviewer, such as a software or data engineer, will look over your answer and give you detailed, written feedback on areas you're doing very well in and areas that could be improved. For example, is your solution the most efficient one possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts? Is your code elegant and easy to read?

Feel free to write this code in your local development environment. In case you do not have the ability to use your local environment or wish to use the classroom to write your code a Jupyter notebook is provided below.
